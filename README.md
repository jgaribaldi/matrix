# Matrix
Toy project.

This was an interview exercise that I did
a few years ago in a company that shall remain
nameless :-)

The idea is to iterate a matrix following a spiral path.

I was asked to implement it in 45 minutes and I did, not
even close to what I did in this project with more
time available, TDD and Kotlin.

I also added a visitor pattern to do something when you
visit a cell.
